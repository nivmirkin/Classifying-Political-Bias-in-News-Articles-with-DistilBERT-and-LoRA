# Classifying-Political-Bias-in-News-Articles-with-DistilBERT-and-LoRA

## Overview

In today's news landscape, understanding political bias is crucial. This project uses DistilBERT and LoRA to classify news articles into left, center, or right categories. It leverages a pre-existing dataset to train and evaluate the model for detecting political bias efficiently.

*The terms 'left' and 'right' first appeared during the French Revolution of 1789. Back then, they referred to the actual seating positions of the Ancien RÃ©gime supporters (Right) and their opponents (Left).*

## Features

- **DistilBERT**: Utilizes the DistilBERT model for text encoding.
- **LoRA**: Applies Low-Rank Adaptation for fine-tuning.

## Prerequisites

To run this project, you will need the following libraries and packages:

- **Python 3.x**: The programming language used for this project.
- **PyTorch**: Required for model training and evaluation.
- **Transformers**: For using DistilBERT and other transformer-based models. 
- **PEFT**: For Low-Rank Adaptation.
- **Datasets**: For handling and processing datasets. 
- **Scikit-learn**: For computing evaluation metrics.

Install the required packages using:

```bash
pip install transformers peft datasets scikit-learn
```

## Installation

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Classifying-Political-Bias-in-News-Articles-with-DistilBERT-and-LoRA.git
cd Classifying-Political-Bias-in-News-Articles-with-DistilBERT-and-LoRA
```

Install the required packages:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
## Data

This project uses a pre-existing dataset for training and evaluation. The dataset is sourced from the following paper:

- **Baly, Ramy, Da San Martino, Giovanni, Glass, James, Nakov, Preslav.** *We Can Detect Your Bias: Predicting the Political Ideology of News Articles*. Proceedings of the 2020 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing (EMNLP), EMNLP~'20, November 2020, pp. 4982--4991, Association for Computational Linguistics.[ Link to paper](https://aclanthology.org/2020.emnlp-main.404.pdf).

#### The columns in the dataset
- **ID**: Unique identifier for each news article.
- **Topic**: The main topic or category of the news article.
- **Source**: The name of the news source or publisher.
- **Source URL**: The URL of the news source or publisher.
- **URL**: The URL where the specific article can be accessed.
- **Date**: The publication date of the article.
- **Authors**: List of authors who wrote the article.
- **Title**: The title of the news article.
- **Content Original**: The original content of the article.
- **Content**: Processed or cleaned content of the article.
- **Bias Text**: The text that indicates the political bias of the article.
- **Bias**: The numerical label representing the political bias of the article (e.g., 0 for left, 1 for center, 2 for right).

## Usage

1. Prepare Data: Ensure your pre-existing dataset is accessible. Modify paths in the script if necessary.

2. Training: Run the training script:
```bash
python train.py
```
The model will be trained and saved to the specified path.

3. Evaluation: The script evaluates the model and logs performance metrics.

## Configuration

- **Training Parameters**: Adjust train_batch_size, eval_batch_size, learning_rate, and num_train_epochs in the script as needed.
- **GPU Usage**:: Ensure fp16=True for GPU acceleration.

## Scripts
- **'train.py'**: Contains code for training and evaluating the model.
- **'requirements.txt'**: Lists required Python packages.
