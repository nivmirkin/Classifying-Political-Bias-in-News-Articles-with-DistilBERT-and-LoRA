# Classifying-Political-Bias-in-News-Articles-with-DistilBERT-and-LoRA

## Overview

In today's news landscape, understanding political bias is crucial. This project uses DistilBERT and LoRA to classify news articles into left, center, or right categories. It leverages a pre-existing dataset to train and evaluate the model for detecting political bias efficiently.

*Figure 1: Oil sketch by David for Le Serment du Jeu de paume showing the titular Tennis Court Oath at Versailles, one of the foundational events of the French Revolution.*<br />
*The terms 'left' and 'right' first appeared during the French Revolution of 1789. Back then, they referred to the actual seating positions of the Ancien RÃ©gime supporters (Right) and their opponents (Left).*

## Features

- **DistilBERT**: Utilizes the DistilBERT model for text encoding.
- **LoRA**: Applies Low-Rank Adaptation for fine-tuning.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- PyTorch
- Transformers library
- Scikit-learn

## Installation

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Classifying-Political-Bias-in-News-Articles-with-DistilBERT-and-LoRA.git
cd Classifying-Political-Bias-in-News-Articles-with-DistilBERT-and-LoRA
```

Install the required packages:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
## Data

This project uses a pre-existing dataset for training and evaluation. The dataset is sourced from the following paper:

- **Baly, Ramy, Da San Martino, Giovanni, Glass, James, Nakov, Preslav.** *We Can Detect Your Bias: Predicting the Political Ideology of News Articles*. Proceedings of the 2020 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing (EMNLP), EMNLP~'20, November 2020, pp. 4982--4991, Association for Computational Linguistics.[ Link to paper](https://pages.github.com/).

## Usage

1. Prepare Data: Ensure your pre-existing dataset is accessible. Modify paths in the script if necessary.

2. Training: Run the training script:
```bash
python train.py
```
The model will be trained and saved to the specified path.

3. Evaluation: The script evaluates the model and logs performance metrics.

## Configuration

- **Training Parameters**: Adjust train_batch_size, eval_batch_size, learning_rate, and num_train_epochs in the script as needed.
- **GPU Usage**:: Ensure fp16=True for GPU acceleration.

## Scripts
- **'train.py'**: Contains code for training and evaluating the model.
- **'requirements.txt'**: Lists required Python packages.
